This directory contains sources for two regular variations of
the stencil code:
1. RCCE_stencil.c uses the "gory" interface and (partly) unsynchronized
   communications. Build it with:
   make API=gory stencil
2. RCCE_stencil_synch.c uses the basic interface and fully synchronized
   communications. Build it with:
   make stencil_synch

In addition, the stencil code was modified to exercise the fine grain
power management features of RCCE/SCC. 
3. RCCE_Fdiv.c sets the tile clock frequency divider to a value
   supplied by the user on the command line.
4. RCCE_FV.c sets the tile clock frequency divider to a value
   supplied by the user on the command line, and also sets the voltage
   to a value that matches the tile clock divider.
5. RCCE_power_reset.c sets the tile clock and voltage to their default
   values.
6. RCCE_pstencil.c gives an example of an application (stencil) with
   power management calls inserted.
