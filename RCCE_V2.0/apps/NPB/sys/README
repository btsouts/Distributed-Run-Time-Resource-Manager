setparams.c:
        Source for the setparams program. This program is used internally
        in the build process to create the file "npbparams.h" for each 
        benchmark. npbparams.h contains Fortran or C parameters to build a 
        benchmark for a specific class and number of nodes. The setparams 
        program is never run directly by a user. Its invocation syntax is 
        "setparams benchmark-name nprocs class". 
        It examines the file "npbparams.h" in the current directory. If 
        the specified parameters are the same as those in the npbparams.h 
        file, nothing it changed. If the file does not exist or corresponds 
        to a different class/number of nodes, it is (re)built. 
	One of the more complicated things in npbparams.h is that it 
        contains, in a Fortran string, the compiler flags used to build a 
        benchmark, so that a benchmark can print out how it was compiled. 

make.common
        A makefile segment that is included in each individual benchmark
        program makefile. It sets up some standard macros (COMPILE, etc) 
        and makes sure everything is configured correctly (npbparams.h)

Makefile
        Builds  setparams
